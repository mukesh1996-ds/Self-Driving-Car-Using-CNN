![Self-Driving Car Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Self-Driving+Car+Using+CNN)

Welcome to the **Self-Driving Car Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** project repository. This project implements an end-to-end deep learning approach based on the groundbreaking research by NVIDIA titled *"End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars."*

The repository aims to replicate and learn from the methods described in the paper, enabling the development of autonomous systems that map raw camera input directly to steering commands.

## üìú About the Research Paper

NVIDIA's paper introduces a revolutionary approach to self-driving cars, leveraging a CNN to directly predict steering commands from raw camera input. Unlike traditional modular systems, this method bypasses intermediate steps like lane detection and path planning, resulting in:
- Simplified architecture.
- Robust performance in diverse driving conditions.
- Autonomous learning of road features from human steering data.

**Key Highlights of the Research:**
- Trained with raw camera images and corresponding steering angles.
- Utilized data augmentation techniques to improve recovery from errors.
- Tested successfully in simulations and real-world road conditions.
- Achieved up to 98% autonomy on highways and local roads.
